Flashcard Learning App
The Flashcard Learning App is an Android application that I created to help users study using digital flashcards.
It has a clean and user-friendly interface that allows users to flip through flashcards to learn new concepts or revise topics.
This app lets users navigate flashcards one by one using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
Each flashcard displays a question on one side and the answer on the other side.
Users can tap on a flashcard to reveal the answer and tap again to hide it.
There's a Reset button that returns the user to the first flashcard in the set.
The main features include:
•	Displaying a series of flashcards with a smooth UI
•	Flip-to-reveal functionality for each flashcard
•	Navigation buttons to go forward 
•	A reset button to restart the flashcard session
I used Kotlin to write the code and developed the app using Android Studio.
